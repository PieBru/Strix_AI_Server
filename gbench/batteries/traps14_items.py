"""TRAPS-14 — language-edge & gotcha battery (operator-provided set, verified).

13 items (item 2 of the original set DROPPED: repr(sum([0.1]*10)) is
version-dependent - CPython 3.12+ exact float summation prints 1.0, <=3.11
prints 0.9999999999999999; ambiguous items have no place in a deterministic
battery). Every surviving expected value verified by live execution on
CPython 3.11 (2026-08-25). Two flavors mixed: implement-to-spec and
predict-exact-output. Consumed by scripts/fcb15_run.py --battery traps.
